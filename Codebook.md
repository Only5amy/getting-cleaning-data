Xtrain: load in 'X_train.txt' which is the training set.
Ytrain: load in 'y_train.txt' which is training labels.
trainingdata: combines all three datasets above.

subjecttest: load in 'subject_test.txt'.
Xtest: load in 'X_test.txt' which is the test set.
Ytest: load in 'y_test.txt' which is the test labels.
