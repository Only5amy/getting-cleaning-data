# getting-cleaning-data 

## Course project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Steps taken: 
- Downloaded UCI HAR dataset
- My script was written in run_analysis.R
- Once my script above is run, the output file generated is called tidydata.txt
